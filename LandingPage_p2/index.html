        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hi there, I am Ujjwal Singh, an aspiring web developer, currently pursuing B.tech CSE  from Galgotias University. I belong to Jaunpur ,Uttar Pradesh but currently I am living in  Noida.</p>
       <p>Computers, how they work and Internet have always fascinated me even as a child, it has been a life long dream for me to be a web designer, I feel intense pleasure in designing web sites. Once mark Zuckerberg said , "The question I ask myself everyday is, Am I doing the most important thing I could be doing" , this question hits me everytime and it keeps pushing me to do better everyday.</p>

      <h2>Greater Noida</h2>
      <p>Greater Noida City is a city with a population in excess of 100,000, located in the Gautam Budh Nagar district of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
      <p>In the early 1980s, the government of India realised that the rapid rate at which Delhi was expanding would result in chaos. Hence, they planned to develop residential and industrial areas around the capital to reduce the demographic burden. Before Greater Noida City, two areas had been developed—Gurgaon, across the border from Haryana, and Noida, across the border with Uttar Pradesh.</p>
